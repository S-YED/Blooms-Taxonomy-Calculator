# 🌸 Bloom's Taxonomy Calculator

Welcome to the **Bloom's Taxonomy Calculator**! 🚀 This app categorizes action verbs based on Bloom's Taxonomy levels, helping educators, students, and self-learners to create and organize learning objectives more effectively.

## 🎓 Overview
Bloom's Taxonomy is an educational framework that classifies cognitive skills into six levels: Remember, Understand, Apply, Analyze, Evaluate, and Create. With this tool, you can quickly identify which cognitive level a verb belongs to, making it ideal for developing curriculum materials, setting learning goals, or understanding the depth of your knowledge!

## 💡 Features
- **Instant Level Detection**: Type in a verb like "define," "analyze," or "design," and the app quickly reveals the Bloom’s Taxonomy level it belongs to.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple, intuitive design—perfect for any device.
- **Educational Tool**: A powerful resource for educators, students, and self-learners to craft and classify learning objectives effectively.
- **Offline Ready**: No server required! Works right in your browser for fast access.

## 🌟 How It Works
1. **Enter a Verb**: Type any action verb (e.g., “describe”).
2. **Click "Check Level"**: Instantly see the corresponding Bloom's level.
3. **Explore More**: Experiment with different verbs to deepen your understanding of each cognitive level.

## 📂 Project Structure
